Why is aikido easy?

<ol>
<li>
There is only one direction: forward. No matter which direction your body moves, your spirit will always move forward. This leads to your weight being mostly on your front leg.
</li>
<li>
Your hands are always in front of you. How convenient, you have something to remind you where your spirit is moving to.
</li>
<li>
Hands are an extension of your center, <span xml:lang="ja">seika tanden</span>, and as such don't really do anything on their own. Every action starts in the center.
</li>
</ol>

I'll list more as I remember them :)
