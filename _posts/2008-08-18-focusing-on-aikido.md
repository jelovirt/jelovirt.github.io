Today I notified my Pekiti-Tirsia Kali instructor that I'll be taking an indefinite leave from studying PTK. I just don't have enough time to study two martial arts and I want to concentrate on the aikido 1st dan test. I'll be taking the test no earlier than a year from now, but I still need to focus more on aikido and one way to do it is to start attending Pertti Lehv√§slaiho's classes regularly.

I still think Pekiti-Tirsia Kali is something I'd like to understand better and I hope in the future I will get a chance to continue studying it.
