title: Universal Declaration of Human Rights in DITA
---
Wanted to try out DITA-OT with multilingual content. So, took the Universal Declaration of Human Rights	from Unicode.org and converted that to DITA. A single BookMap which the declaration in all available languages is exactly 1,500 pages. The set would make a lovely test in the DITA-OT test suite, but the files don't seem to be available under any suitable license. Still, a good test set.
