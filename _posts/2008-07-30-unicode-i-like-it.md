I'm a software developer and I like Unicode. I think I would like it if I wasn't, but still. I just realized Unicode contains the characters used for Apple modifier keys:

<dl>
<dt>⌥</dt><dd>[option](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_key)</dd>
<dt>⌘</dt><dd>[command](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key)</dd>
<dt>⌃</dt><dd>[control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_key)</dd>
</dl>

Will that make a difference in my life, ever? Probably not, but I think it's still cool that I could use those characters in text if I wanted to. As in, instead of writing <q>press <strong>Option-Command-Esc</strong></q>, I would write <q>press <strong>⌥ ⌘ Esc</strong></q>. Yey!
