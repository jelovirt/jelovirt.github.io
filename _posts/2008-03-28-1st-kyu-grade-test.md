Had my 1st <span class="aikido-term">kyu</span> grade test two days. All in all, it went pretty well and I'm happy with how it went. Manderbacka was judging the test and she commented that it looked "<span xml:lang="fi">nätti</span>" ("pretty"), which… I'm not 100% sure what that means, but I suppose it means it didn't look ugly or awful. She did comment that I should do less, let <span class="aikido-term">uke</span> do more. I was nervous in the test, so I probably didn't want to give <span class="aikido-term">uke</span> too much space or time, but I'm sure the comment also applies to my technique in general. Also, she said my technique had quite a lot of "<span xml:lang="fi">mättö</span>" (hard to translate, basically being a bit too heavy handed), but she did say that when you're young, that's the time for it if ever. One of the things she said that felt really nice was that my <span class="aikido-term">jiyuwaza</span> looked like I hadn't planned anything, that I hadn't decided which techniques to use beforehand. The <span class="aikido-term">jiyuwaza</span> was far from perfect, but it felp pretty good. I didn't panic or get too overwhelmed by the attacks. There isn't really anything I'd like to do differently, but it would have been nice if we could have show the <span class="aikido-term">jo</span> <span class="aikido-term">kata</span>s more than once.

Now I can start studying <span class="aikido-term">aikido</span> again, not just the grade test techniques. To start taking it easy again. I think I'm going to study <span class="aikido-term">jo</span> <span class="aikido-term">kata</span> 22, as it was removed from the grade test technique list and I didn't practice it for the test.
