title: DITA-OT develpment FAQ

Q: Why don't you only work on Muuntaja, a fork of DITA-OT?  
A: Because if I stopped working for main DITA-OT, there would only be one developer left and the development would slow down considerably. Also, I get more "users" by improving DITA-OT and that's one of the reasons I work for DITA-OT, to help out people.
