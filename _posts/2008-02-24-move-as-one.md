<blockquote lang="fr">Aimer, ce n'est pas se regarder l'un l'autre, c'est regarder ensemble dans la même direction.</blockquote>  
–Antoine de Saint Exupéry

(For those of you who don't speak French, that's, <q>love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking together in the same direction</q>.) I think MK was in right quoting that in his class, it's a good thought for aikido.
