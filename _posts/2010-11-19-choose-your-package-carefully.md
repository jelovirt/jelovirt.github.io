I don't know what the situation was back when the project started, but if you now look at the DITA-OT Java package <code>org.dita.dost</code>, it makes you think why didn't they choose something else. The package <code>org.dita</code> looks correct, but if you visit <a href="http://www.dita.org/" rel="nofollow">dita.org</a> you'll see that the domain is used to host a personal website.

There is no real reason to change the current package name, but you have to admit that e.g. <code>net.sf.dita-ot</code> or <code>org.xml.dita</code> would have been more suitable.
