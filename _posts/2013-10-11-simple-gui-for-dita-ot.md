## Simple GUI for DITA-OT

I switched jobs recently and one of the new things I've done is write Eclipse plug-ins. You know, GUI stuff. Simple enough. So I'll probably write a simple GUI to DITA-OT. I'll leave the advanced stuff to [oXygen XML Editor](http://oxygenxml.com/), this will something that just has basic functionality. The difference to oXygen will be that I'll run DITA-OT in the same JVM as Eclipse. This way the GUI will have more direct access to the log and at least in theory it may be a little faster on small jobs.
