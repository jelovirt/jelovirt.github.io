Studied <span class="aikido-term">kotegaeshi</span> with ML yesterday after the beginners class and right now I think <span class="aikido-term">kotegaeshi</span> is all about timing, not about hand, feet, or <span class="aikido-term">hara</span> movement.
The hand and feet movement is important, you have to have that working first so that you don't have to focus on yourself throughout the execution of the technique. Also, you should keep in mind that the power comes from your <span class="aikido-term">hara</span>, <span lang="ja">kotegaeshi</span> is not about twisting the <span class="aikido-term">uke</span>'s wrist and forcing them go down. However, right now it feels like the moment you throw is the key to just about everything; if you wait until <span class="aikido-term">uke</span> has regained their balance after the initial guidance, it's too late. The thing that I use as a guideline is <span lang="ja">uke</span>'s feet, specifically the rear one. If you let the <span class="aikido-term">uke</span> to land the foot firmly on the ground after they turn towards you, you have either off-balance them again or simply use brute force and turn the wrist. By changing the timing to throw <em>before</em> the rear foot lands or just at the moment when it taps on the <span lang="ja">tatami</span>, <span class="aikido-term">uke</span> is still light and moving and can be easily guided by turning the wrist and dropping your <span class="aikido-term">hara</span>.
